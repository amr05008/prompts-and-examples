We're close to [milestone]. What's needed to complete it?

### Full Context (after break)

### Project Specific - aaronroy.com
Review the last session in claude.md and the launch checklist. What's the most critical item for getting aaronroy.com live? Think hard.

### Discovery
Explore my code base. I'd like to prepare this Astro site to replace the website that's currently being served on https://aaronroy.com (which is built on wordpress). What other considerations should I make before deploying this via Vercel? Beyond deploying via Vercel what other todo's do I have to have this site replace the current aaronroy.com? Don't make changes yet, just give me a comprehensive audit.

Current status of my Astro site is contained in the claude.md file.
